# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ariff!

I'm a data engineer.

My focus is on designing robust data pipelines that help teams to gain their insights from information, reliably and frequently.

I strive to deliver projects that are feature-rich and flexible to the client's specifications and needs, while being scalable and easily maintained over time.

My favourite technologies are PySpark and PostgreSQL.
