# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ariff!

I'm a software engineer, mainly working with web development while dabbling in some data engineering on the side.

My focus is on designing robust data pipelines that help teams to gain their insights from information, reliably and frequently.

I strive to deliver projects that are feature-rich and flexible to the client's specifications and needs, while being scalable and easily maintained over time.

My favourite technologies are PySpark and PostgreSQL.
